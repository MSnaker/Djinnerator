b'Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, \n'
b'were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \n'
b'thank you very much. They were the last people you\xe2\x80\x99d \n'
b'expect to be involved in anything strange or \n'
b'mysterious, because they just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold with such \n'
b'Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \n'
b'Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \n'
b'man with hardly any neck, although he did have a \n'
b'very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and \n'
b'blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \n'
b'neck, which came in very useful as she spent so \n'
b'much of her time craning over garden fences, spying \n'
b'on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son \n'
b'called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \n'
b'The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \n'
b'also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \n'
b'somebody would discover it. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they \n'
b'could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. \n'
b'Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\xe2\x80\x99s sister, but they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
Page2
b'met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended \n'
b'she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a sister, because her sister and her \n'
b'good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \n'
b'was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think \n'
b'what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \n'
b'the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \n'
b'small son, too, but they had never even seen him. \n'
b'This boy was another good reason for keeping the \n'
b'Potters away; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Dudley mixing with a \n'
b'When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \n'
b'Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \n'
b'cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \n'
b'mysterious things would soon be happening all over \n'
b'the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out \n'
b'his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \n'
b'gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \n'
b'Dudley into his high chair. \n'
b'None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \n'
b'At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his \n'
b'briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and \n'
b'tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \n'
b'Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \n'
b'cereal at the walls. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle tyke,\xe2\x80\x9d chortled Mr. Dursley \n'
b'as he left the house. He got into his car and backed \n'
b'out of number four\xe2\x80\x99s drive. \n'
b'It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \n'
b'first sign of something peculiar \xe2\x80\x94 a cat reading a \n'
b'map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize what he \n'
b'had seen \xe2\x80\x94 then he jerked his head around to look \n'
b'again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \n'
b'of Privet Drive, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a map in sight. What \n'
b'could he have been thinking of? It must have been a \n'
b'trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at \n'
Page3
b'the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \n'
b'the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his \n'
b'mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet \n'
b'Drive \xe2\x80\x94 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read \n'
b'maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake \n'
b'and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward \n'
b'town he thought of nothing except a large order of \n'
b'drills he was hoping to get that day. \n'
b'But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his \n'
b'mind by something else. As he sat in the usual \n'
b'morning traffic jam, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help noticing that \n'
b'there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \n'
b'about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear \n'
b'people who dressed in funny clothes \xe2\x80\x94 the getups \n'
b'you saw on young people! He supposed this was some \n'
b'stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the \n'
b'steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \n'
b'weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \n'
b'excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \n'
b'that a couple of them weren\xe2\x80\x99t young at all; why, that \n'
b'man had to be older than he was, and wearing an \n'
b'emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it \n'
b'struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \n'
b'stunt \xe2\x80\x94 these people were obviously collecting for \n'
b'something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \n'
b'on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \n'
b'Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n'
b'Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in \n'
b'his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, he might \n'
b'have found it harder to concentrate on drills that \n'
b'morning. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the owls swooping past in \n'
b'broad daylight, though people down in the street did; \n'
b'they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \n'
b'owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an \n'
b'owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \n'
b'perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \n'
b'different people. He made several important telephone \n'
Page4
b'calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \n'
b'mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d stretch \n'
b'his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \n'
b'bun from the bakery. \n'
b'He\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \n'
b'passed a group of them next to the baker\xe2\x80\x99s. He eyed \n'
b'them angrily as he passed. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but \n'
b'they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering \n'
b'excitedly, too, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single collecting \n'
b'tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a \n'
b'large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \n'
b'of what they were saying. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Potters, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I heard \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x94 yes, their son, Harry \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He \n'
b'looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \n'
b'something to them, but thought better of it. \n'
b'He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his \n'
b'office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, \n'
b'seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing \n'
b'his home number when he changed his mind. He put \n'
b'the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, \n'
b'thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots \n'
b'of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \n'
b'Come to think of it, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure his nephew \n'
b'was called Harry. He\xe2\x80\x99d never even seen the boy. It \n'
b'might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \n'
b'point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so \n'
b'upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame \n'
b'her \xe2\x80\x94 if he\xe2\x80\x99d had a sister like that ... but all the \n'
b'same, those people in cloaks ... \n'
Page5
b'He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \n'
b'afternoon and when he left the building at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, \n'
b'he was still so worried that he walked straight into \n'
b'someone just outside the door. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \n'
b'and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. \n'
b'Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \n'
b'cloak. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all upset at being almost \n'
b'knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split \n'
b'into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \n'
b'made passersby stare, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry, my dear sir, \n'
b'for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \n'
b'Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \n'
b'yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \n'
b'And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \n'
b'middle and walked off. \n'
b'Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been \n'
b'hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he \n'
b'had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was \n'
b'rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, \n'
b'hoping he was imagining things, which he had never \n'
b'hoped before, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of \n'
b'As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \n'
b'first thing he saw \xe2\x80\x94 and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t improve his mood \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'was the tabby cat he\xe2\x80\x99d spotted that morning. It was \n'
b'now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the \n'
b'same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShoo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dursley loudly. \n'
b'The cat didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. It just gave him a stern look. \n'
b'Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. \n'
b'Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the \n'
Page6
b'house. He was still determined not to mention \n'
b'anything to his wife. \n'
b'Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told \n'
b'him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\xe2\x80\x99s problems \n'
b'with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new \n'
b'word (\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \n'
b'When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \n'
b'living room in time to catch the last report on the \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \n'
b'that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s owls have been behaving very \n'
b'unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at \n'
b'night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \n'
b'been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \n'
b'every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to \n'
b'explain why the owls have suddenly changed their \n'
b'sleeping pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d The newscaster allowed himself a \n'
b'grin. \xe2\x80\x9cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim \n'
b'McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more \n'
b'showers of owls tonight, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the weatherman, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about \n'
b'that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not only the owls that have been acting \n'
b'oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, \n'
b'and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \n'
b'instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a \n'
b'downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have \n'
b'been celebrating Bonfire Night early \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not until \n'
b'next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night \n'
b'Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars \n'
b'all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious \n'
b'people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a \n'
b'whisper about the Potters . . . \n'
Page7
b'Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two \n'
b'cups of tea. It was no good. He\xe2\x80\x99d have to say \n'
b'something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cEr \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x94 Petunia, dear \xe2\x80\x94 you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from your sister \n'
b'As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and \n'
b'angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFunny stuff on the news,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOwls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \n'
b'funny-looking people in town today ...\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo?\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \n'
b'do with ... you know ... her crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. \n'
b'Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\xe2\x80\x99d \n'
b'heard the name \xe2\x80\x9cPotter.\xe2\x80\x9d He decided he didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare. \n'
b'Instead he said, as casually as he could, \xe2\x80\x9cTheir son \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'he\xe2\x80\x99d be about Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s age now, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s his name again? Howard, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking \n'
b'horribly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I quite agree.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say another word on the subject as they \n'
b'went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the \n'
b'bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window \n'
Page8
b'and peered down into the front garden. The cat was \n'
b'still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though \n'
b'it were waiting for something. \n'
b'Was he imagining things? Could all this have \n'
b'anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out \n'
b'that they were related to a pair of \xe2\x80\x94 well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'think he could bear it. \n'
b'The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep \n'
b'quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \n'
b'in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell \n'
b'asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \n'
b'there was no reason for them to come near him and \n'
b'Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \n'
b'Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He \n'
b'couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up \n'
b'in anything that might be going on \xe2\x80\x94 he yawned and \n'
b'turned over \xe2\x80\x94 it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t affect them. ... \n'
b'How very wrong he was. \n'
b'Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \n'
b'sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \n'
b'sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, \n'
b'its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \n'
b'Drive. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as quiver when a car door \n'
b'slammed on the next street, nor when two owls \n'
b'swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \n'
b'before the cat moved at all. \n'
b'A man appeared on the corner the cat had been \n'
b'watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\xe2\x80\x99d \n'
b'have thought he\xe2\x80\x99d just popped out of the ground. The \n'
b'cat\xe2\x80\x99s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \n'
b'Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet \n'
b'Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \n'
b'silver of his hair and beard, which were both long \n'
Page9
b'enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long \n'
b'robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \n'
b'high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, \n'
b'bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \n'
b'and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \n'
b'had been broken at least twice. This man\xe2\x80\x99s name was \n'
b'Albus Dumbledore didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to realize that he had \n'
b'just arrived in a street where everything from his \n'
b'name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy \n'
b'rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But \n'
b'he did seem to realize he was being watched, because \n'
b'he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \n'
b'staring at him from the other end of the street. For \n'
b'some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \n'
b'him. He chuckled and muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have \n'
b'He found what he was looking for in his inside \n'
b'pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He \n'
b'flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \n'
b'The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He \n'
b'clicked it again \xe2\x80\x94 the next lamp flickered into \n'
b'darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, \n'
b'until the only lights left on the whole street were two \n'
b'tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \n'
b'the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their \n'
b'window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they \n'
b'wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to see anything that was happening \n'
b'down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- \n'
b'Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the \n'
b'street toward number four, where he sat down on the \n'
b'wall next to the cat. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at it, but after a \n'
b'moment he spoke to it. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page10
b'He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. \n'
b'Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \n'
b'woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \n'
b'shape of the markings the cat had had around its \n'
b'eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \n'
b'Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She \n'
b'looked distinctly ruffled. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know it was me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Professor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be stiff if you\xe2\x80\x99d been sitting on a brick wall all \n'
b'day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I \n'
b'must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \n'
b'Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s celebrating, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \n'
b'impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think they\xe2\x80\x99d be a bit more careful, \n'
b'but no \xe2\x80\x94 even the Muggles have noticed something\xe2\x80\x99s \n'
b'going on. It was on their news.\xe2\x80\x9d She jerked her head \n'
b'back at the Dursleys\xe2\x80\x99 dark living-room window. \xe2\x80\x9cI \n'
b'heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, \n'
b'they\xe2\x80\x99re not completely stupid. They were bound to \n'
b'notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll \n'
b'bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t blame them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore gently. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to lose our heads. People are \n'
b'being downright careless, out on the streets in broad \n'
Page11
b'daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, \n'
b'She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore \n'
b'here, as though hoping he was going to tell her \n'
b'something, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, so she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cA fine \n'
b'thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who \n'
b'seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found \n'
b'out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly seems so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have \n'
b'much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lemon drop. They\xe2\x80\x99re a kind of Muggle sweet I\xe2\x80\x99m \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as \n'
b'though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this was the moment for \n'
b'lemon drops. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like \n'
b'yourself can call him by his name? All this You- \n'
b'Know-Who\xe2\x80\x99 nonsense \xe2\x80\x94 for eleven years I have been \n'
b'trying to persuade people to call him by his proper \n'
b'name: Voldemort.\xe2\x80\x9d Professor McGonagall flinched, but \n'
b'Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, \n'
b'seemed not to notice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt all gets so confusing if we \n'
b'keep saying You-Know-Who.\xe2\x80\x99 I have never seen any \n'
b'reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor McGonagall, \n'
b'sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re \n'
b'different. Everyone knows you\xe2\x80\x99re the only one You- \n'
b'Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cVoldemort \n'
b'had powers I will never have.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because you\xe2\x80\x99re too \xe2\x80\x94 well \xe2\x80\x94 noble to use \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky it\xe2\x80\x99s dark. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t blushed so much since \n'
b'Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at \n'
b'Dumbledore and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe owls are nothing next to \n'
b'the rumors that are flying around. You know what \n'
b'everyone\xe2\x80\x99s saying? About why he\xe2\x80\x99s disappeared? \n'
b'About what finally stopped him?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the \n'
b'point she was most anxious to discuss, the real \n'
b'reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all \n'
b'day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she \n'
b'fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she \n'
b'did now. It was plain that whatever \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone\xe2\x80\x9d was \n'
b'saying, she was not going to believe it until \n'
b'Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, \n'
b'however, was choosing another lemon drop and did \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they\xe2\x80\x99re saying,\xe2\x80\x9d she pressed on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that last \n'
b'night Voldemort turned up in Godric\xe2\x80\x99s Hollow. He \n'
b'went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and \n'
b'James Potter are \xe2\x80\x94 are \xe2\x80\x94 that they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x94 dead.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLily and James ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it ... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \n'
b'believe it ... Oh, Albus ...\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the \n'
b'shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI know ... I know ...\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily. \n'
Page13
b'Professor McGonagall\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled as she went \n'
b'on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not all. They\xe2\x80\x99re saying he tried to kill the \n'
b'Potters\xe2\x80\x99 son, Harry. But \xe2\x80\x94 he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but \n'
b'they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that when he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill Harry Potter, \n'
b'Voldemort\xe2\x80\x99s power somehow broke \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s why \n'
b'Dumbledore nodded glumly. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s true?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Professor McGonagall. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter \n'
b'all he\xe2\x80\x99s done ... all the people he\xe2\x80\x99s killed ... he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'kill a little boy? It\xe2\x80\x99s just astounding ... of all the \n'
b'things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven \n'
b'did Harry survive?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can only guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may \n'
b'Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \n'
b'and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. \n'
b'Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden \n'
b'watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very \n'
b'odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \n'
b'instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It \n'
b'must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, \n'
b'because he put it back in his pocket and said, \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHagrid\xe2\x80\x99s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\xe2\x80\x99d be \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell me why you\xe2\x80\x99re here, of all \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. \n'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re the only family he has left now.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x94 you can\xe2\x80\x99t mean the people who \n'
b'live here?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her \n'
Page14
b'feet and pointing at number four. \xe2\x80\x9cDumbledore \xe2\x80\x94 you \n'
b'can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching them all day. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'find two people who are less like us. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve got \n'
b'this son \xe2\x80\x94 I saw him kicking his mother all the way \n'
b'up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter \n'
b'come and live here!\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best place for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore firmly. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \n'
b'to him when he\xe2\x80\x99s older. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written them a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA letter?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, \n'
b'sitting back down on the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, Dumbledore, \n'
b'you think you can explain all this in a letter? These \n'
b'people will never understand him! He\xe2\x80\x99ll be famous \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'a legend \xe2\x80\x94 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if today was \n'
b'known as Harry Potter Day in the future \xe2\x80\x94 there will \n'
b'be books written about Harry \xe2\x80\x94 every child in our \n'
b'world will know his name!\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously \n'
b'over the top of his half-moon glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be \n'
b'enough to turn any boy\xe2\x80\x99s head. Famous before he can \n'
b'walk and talk! Famous for something he won\xe2\x80\x99t even \n'
b'remember! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see how much better off he\xe2\x80\x99ll be, \n'
b'growing up away from all that until he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to take \n'
b'Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her \n'
b'mind, swallowed, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes \xe2\x80\x94 yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re \n'
b'right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, \n'
b'Dumbledore?\xe2\x80\x9d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though \n'
b'she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHagrid\xe2\x80\x99s bringing him.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it \xe2\x80\x94 wise \xe2\x80\x94 to trust Hagrid with \n'
b'something as important as this?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page15
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying his heart isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the right place,\xe2\x80\x9d said \n'
b'Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'pretend he\xe2\x80\x99s not careless. He does tend to \xe2\x80\x94 what \n'
b'A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \n'
b'them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and \n'
b'down the street for some sign of a headlight; it \n'
b'swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \n'
b'on the road in front of them. \n'
b'If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man \n'
b'sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a \n'
b'normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked \n'
b'simply too big to be allowed, and so wild \xe2\x80\x94 long \n'
b'tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \n'
b'face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his \n'
b'feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In \n'
b'his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHagrid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cAt \n'
b'last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the \n'
b'giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he \n'
b'spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him, \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo problems, were there?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir \xe2\x80\x94 house was almost destroyed, but I got him \n'
b'out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\xe2\x80\x99 \n'
b'around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\xe2\x80\x99 over Bristol.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page16
b'Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward \n'
b'over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a \n'
b'baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair \n'
b'over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \n'
b'cut, like a bolt of lightning. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs that where \xe2\x80\x94 ?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Professor McGonagall. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore. \xe2\x80\x9cHell have that scar forever.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven if I could, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Scars can come in handy. \n'
b'I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \n'
b'map of the London Underground. Well \xe2\x80\x94 give him \n'
b'here, Hagrid \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99d better get this over with.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned \n'
b'toward the Dursleys\xe2\x80\x99 house. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCould I \xe2\x80\x94 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked \n'
b'Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry \n'
b'and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, \n'
b'whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl \n'
b'like a wounded dog. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShhh!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Professor McGonagall, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll wake the \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cS-s-sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted \n'
b'handkerchief and burying his face in it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I c-c- \n'
b'can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it \xe2\x80\x94 Lily an\xe2\x80\x99 James dead \xe2\x80\x94 an\xe2\x80\x99 poor little \n'
b'Harry off ter live with Muggles \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, \n'
b'Hagrid, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll be found,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor McGonagall \n'
b'whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as \n'
b'Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \n'
b'walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the \n'
Page17
b'doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it \n'
b'inside Harry\xe2\x80\x99s blankets, and then came back to the \n'
b'other two. For a full minute the three of them stood \n'
b'and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders \n'
b'shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and \n'
b'the twinkling light that usually shone from \n'
b'Dumbledore\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seemed to have gone out. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbledore finally, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve no \n'
b'business staying here. We may as well go and join the \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d best \n'
b'get this bike away. G \xe2\x80\x99night, Professor McGonagall \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'Professor Dumbledore, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid \n'
b'swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the \n'
b'engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor \n'
b'McGonagall blew her nose in reply. \n'
b'Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \n'
b'On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- \n'
b'Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light \n'
b'sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive \n'
b'glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \n'
b'tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \n'
b'of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets \n'
b'on the step of number four. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. He turned on his \n'
b'heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. \n'
b'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which \n'
b'lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last \n'
Page18
b'place you would expect astonishing things to happen. \n'
b'Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without \n'
b'waking up. One small hand closed on the letter \n'
b'beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was \n'
b'special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he \n'
b'would be woken in a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 time by Mrs. \n'
b'Dursley\xe2\x80\x99s scream as she opened the front door to put \n'
b'out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next \n'
b'few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin \n'
b'Dudley. ... He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that at this very \n'
b'moment, people meeting in secret all over the country \n'
b'were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed \n'
b'voices: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Harry Potter \xe2\x80\x94 the boy who lived!\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page19
b'Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had \n'
b'woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \n'
b'Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose \n'
b'on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \n'
b'number four on the Dursleys\xe2\x80\x99 front door; it crept into \n'
b'their living room, which was almost exactly the same \n'
b'as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had \n'
b'seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the \n'
b'photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \n'
b'much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been \n'
b'lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \n'
b'ball wearing different-colored bonnets \xe2\x80\x94 but Dudley \n'
b'Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the \n'
b'photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \n'
b'bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \n'
b'game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \n'
b'mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy \n'
b'lived in the house, too. \n'
b'Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \n'
b'but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it \n'
Page20
b'was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \n'
b'Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUp!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward \n'
b'the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \n'
b'being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and \n'
b'tried to remember the dream he had been having. It \n'
b'had been a good one. There had been a flying \n'
b'motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\xe2\x80\x99d had the \n'
b'His aunt was back outside the door. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you up yet?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the \n'
b'bacon. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare let it burn, I want \n'
b'everything perfect on Duddy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d his aunt snapped through the \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing ...\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s birthday \xe2\x80\x94 how could he have forgotten? \n'
b'Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \n'
b'socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after \n'
b'pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry \n'
b'was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \n'
b'stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \n'
Page21
b'When he was dressed he went down the hall into the \n'
b'kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all \n'
b'Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s birthday presents. It looked as though \n'
b'Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not \n'
b'to mention the second television and the racing bike. \n'
b'Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a \n'
b'mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated \n'
b'exercise \xe2\x80\x94 unless of course it involved punching \n'
b'somebody. Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s favorite punching bag was Harry, \n'
b'but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t often catch him. Harry didn\xe2\x80\x99t look it, \n'
b'but he was very fast. \n'
b'Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \n'
b'cupboard, but Harry had always been small and \n'
b'skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and \n'
b'skinnier than he really was because all he had to \n'
b'wear were old clothes of Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s, and Dudley was \n'
b'about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin \n'
b'face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \n'
b'eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot \n'
b'of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had \n'
b'punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \n'
b'about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \n'
b'forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He \n'
b'had had it as long as he could remember, and the \n'
b'first question he could ever remember asking his \n'
b'Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the car crash when your parents died,\xe2\x80\x9d she had \n'
b'said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions \xe2\x80\x94 that was the first rule for a \n'
b'quiet life with the Dursleys. \n'
b'Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was \n'
b'turning over the bacon. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cComb your hair!\xe2\x80\x9d he barked, by way of a morning \n'
Page22
b'About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top \n'
b'of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a \n'
b'haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the \n'
b'rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made \n'
b'no difference, his hair simply grew that way \xe2\x80\x94 all over \n'
b'Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in \n'
b'the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like \n'
b'Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much \n'
b'neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair \n'
b'that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia \n'
b'often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a \n'
b'Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, \n'
b'which was difficult as there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much room. \n'
b'Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-six,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking up at his mother and \n'
b'father. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s two less than last year.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t counted Auntie Marge\xe2\x80\x99s present, \n'
b'see, it\xe2\x80\x99s here under this big one from Mommy and \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, thirty-seven then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dudley, going red \n'
b'in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley \n'
b'tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as \n'
b'fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \n'
b'Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because \n'
b'she said quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you another two \n'
b'presents while we\xe2\x80\x99re out today. How\xe2\x80\x99s that, popkin? \n'
b'Two more presents. Is that all right?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page23
b'Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard \n'
b'work. Finally he said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99ll have thirty ... \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-nine, sweetums,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Petunia. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the \n'
b'nearest parcel. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right then.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Uncle Vernon chuckled. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLittle tyke wants his money\xe2\x80\x99s worth, just like his \n'
b'father. \xe2\x80\x99Atta boy, Dudley!\xe2\x80\x9d He ruffled Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s hair. \n'
b'At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia \n'
b'went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon \n'
b'watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video \n'
b'camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new \n'
b'computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the \n'
b'paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came \n'
b'back from the telephone looking both angry and \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBad news, Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Figg\xe2\x80\x99s broken her \n'
b'leg. She can\xe2\x80\x99t take him.\xe2\x80\x9d She jerked her head in \n'
b'Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\xe2\x80\x99s heart \n'
b'gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, his \n'
b'parents took him and a friend out for the day, to \n'
b'adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the \n'
b'movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. \n'
b'Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. \n'
b'Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of \n'
b'cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs \n'
b'of all the cats she\xe2\x80\x99d ever owned. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at \n'
b'Harry as though he\xe2\x80\x99d planned this. Harry knew he \n'
Page24
b'ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, \n'
b'but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy when he reminded himself it would \n'
b'be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, \n'
b'Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe could phone Marge,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle Vernon suggested. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as \n'
b'though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, as though he was \n'
b'something very nasty that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them, \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about what\xe2\x80\x99s-her-name, your friend \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn vacation in Majorca,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Aunt Petunia. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou could just leave me here,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry put in hopefully \n'
b'(he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to watch what he wanted on television \n'
b'for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s \n'
b'Aunt Petunia looked as though she\xe2\x80\x99d just swallowed a \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\xe2\x80\x9d she \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t blow up the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, but they \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt \n'
b'Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat cars new, he\xe2\x80\x99s not sitting in it alone. ...\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
Page25
b'Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really \n'
b'crying \xe2\x80\x94 it had been years since he\xe2\x80\x99d really cried \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'but he knew that if he screwed up his face and \n'
b'wailed, his mother would give him anything he \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDinky Duddydums, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, Mummy won\xe2\x80\x99t let him \n'
b'spoil your special day!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, flinging her arms \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI ... don\xe2\x80\x99t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!\xe2\x80\x9d Dudley \n'
b'yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always sp- \n'
b'spoils everything!\xe2\x80\x9d He shot Harry a nasty grin through \n'
b'the gap in his mothers arms. \n'
b'Just then, the doorbell rang \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Lord, \n'
b'they\xe2\x80\x99re here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Petunia frantically \xe2\x80\x94 and a \n'
b'moment later, Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, Piers Polkiss, \n'
b'walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy \n'
b'with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who \n'
b'held people\xe2\x80\x99s arms behind their backs while Dudley \n'
b'hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \n'
b'Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe his \n'
b'luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\xe2\x80\x99 car with \n'
b'Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first \n'
b'time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able \n'
b'to think of anything else to do with him, but before \n'
b'they\xe2\x80\x99d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m warning you,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said, putting his large \n'
b'purple face right up close to Harry\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m warning you \n'
b'now, boy \xe2\x80\x94 any funny business, anything at all \xe2\x80\x94 \n'
b'and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in that cupboard from now until \n'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9chonestly \n'
Page26
b'But Uncle Vernon didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. No one ever did. \n'
b'The problem was, strange things often happened \n'
b'around Harry and it was just no good telling the \n'
b'Dursleys he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make them happen. \n'
b'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from \n'
b'the barbers looking as though he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been at all, \n'
b'had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair \n'
b'so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, \n'
b'which she left \xe2\x80\x9cto hide that horrible scar.\xe2\x80\x9d Dudley had \n'
b'laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless \n'
b'night imagining school the next day, where he was \n'
b'already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped \n'
b'glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to \n'
b'find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt \n'
b'Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week \n'
b'in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to \n'
b'explain that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain how it had grown \n'
b'Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force \n'
b'him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s (brown \n'
b'with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it \n'
b'over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until \n'
b'finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \n'
b'certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided \n'
b'it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great \n'
b'relief, Harry wasn\xe2\x80\x99t punished. \n'
b'On the other hand, he\xe2\x80\x99d gotten into terrible trouble \n'
b'for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. \n'
b'Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s gang had been chasing him as usual when, \n'
b'as much to Harry\xe2\x80\x99s surprise as anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s, there he \n'
b'was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had \n'
b'received a very angry letter from Harry\xe2\x80\x99s headmistress \n'
b'telling them Harry had been climbing school \n'
b'buildings. But all he\xe2\x80\x99d tried to do (as he shouted at \n'
b'Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his \n'
Page27
b'cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans \n'
b'outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the \n'
b'wind must have caught him in mid-jump. \n'
b'But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even \n'
b'worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the \n'
b'day somewhere that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t school, his cupboard, or \n'
b'Mrs. Figg\xe2\x80\x99s cabbage-smelling living room. \n'
b'While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt \n'
b'Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at \n'
b'work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry \n'
b'were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, \n'
b'it was motorcycles. \n'
b'"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \n'
b'remembering suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was flying.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He \n'
b'turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, \n'
b'his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dudley and Piers sniggered. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know they don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'But he wished he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything. If there was \n'
b'one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his \n'
b'asking questions, it was his talking about anything \n'
b'acting in a way it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, no matter if it was in a \n'
b'dream or even a cartoon \xe2\x80\x94 they seemed to think he \n'
b'might get dangerous ideas. \n'
b'It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was \n'
b'crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley \n'
Page28
b'and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \n'
b'and then, because the smiling lady in the van had \n'
b'asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry \n'
b'him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It \n'
b'wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they \n'
b'watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked \n'
b'remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t blond. \n'
b'Harry had the best morning he\xe2\x80\x99d had in a long time. \n'
b'He was careful to walk a little way apart from the \n'
b'Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting \n'
b'to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \n'
b'fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They \n'
b'ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a \n'
b'tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\xe2\x80\x99t have \n'
b'enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him \n'
b'another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \n'
b'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it \n'
b'was all too good to last. \n'
b'After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool \n'
b'and dark in there, with lit windows all along the \n'
b'walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes \n'
b'were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \n'
b'stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, \n'
b'poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. \n'
b'Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It \n'
b'could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle \n'
b'Vernon\xe2\x80\x99s car and crushed it into a trash can \xe2\x80\x94 but at \n'
b'the moment it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look in the mood. In fact, it was \n'
b'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, \n'
b'staring at the glistening brown coils. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMake it move,\xe2\x80\x9d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon \n'
b'tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\xe2\x80\x99t budge. \n'
Page29
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo it again,\xe2\x80\x9d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped \n'
b'the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is boring,\xe2\x80\x9d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \n'
b'Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \n'
b'at the snake. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been surprised if it \n'
b'had died of boredom itself \xe2\x80\x94 no company except \n'
b'stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \n'
b'trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than \n'
b'having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only \n'
b'visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to \n'
b'wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the \n'
b'The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, \n'
b'very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a \n'
b'level with Harry\xe2\x80\x99s. \n'
b'Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if \n'
b'anyone was watching. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t. He looked back \n'
b'at the snake and winked, too. \n'
b'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and \n'
b'Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave \n'
b'Harry a look that said quite plainly: \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI get that all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry murmured through the glass, though \n'
b'he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure the snake could hear him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be \n'
b'The snake nodded vigorously. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d Harry asked. \n'
Page30
b'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the \n'
b'glass. Harry peered at it. \n'
b'Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWas it nice there?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again \n'
b'and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the \n'
b'zoo. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see \xe2\x80\x94 so you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to Brazil?\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout \n'
b'behind Harry made both of them jump. \xe2\x80\x9cDUDLEY! \n'
b'MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! \n'
b'YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT\xe2\x80\x99S DOING!\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he \n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the way, you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, punching Harry in the \n'
b'ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the \n'
b'concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no \n'
b'one saw how it happened \xe2\x80\x94 one second, Piers and \n'
b'Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the \n'
b'next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \n'
b'Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \n'
b'constrictor\xe2\x80\x99s tank had vanished. The great snake was \n'
b'uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. \n'
b'People throughout the reptile house screamed and \n'
b'started running for the exits. \n'
b'As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have \n'
b'sworn a low, hissing voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cBrazil, here I come. \n'
b'... Thanksss, amigo.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'
b'The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \n'
