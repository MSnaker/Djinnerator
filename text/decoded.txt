b'mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive \n'
b'were proud to say that they were perfectly normal \n'
b'thank you very much they were the last people youd \n'
b'expect to be involved in anything strange or \n'
b'mysterious because they just didnt hold with such \n'
b'mr dursley was the director of a firm called \n'
b'grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy \n'
b'man with hardly any neck although he did have a \n'
b'very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and \n'
b'blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \n'
b'neck which came in very useful as she spent so \n'
b'much of her time craning over garden fences spying \n'
b'on the neighbors the dursley s had a small son \n'
b'called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \n'
b'the dursleys had everything they wanted but they \n'
b'also had a secret and their greatest fear was that \n'
b'somebody would discover it they didnt think they \n'
b'could bear it if anyone found out about the potters \n'
b'mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt \n'
Page2
b'met for several years; in fact mrs dursley pretended \n'
b'she didnt have a sister because her sister and her \n'
b'goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it \n'
b'was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think \n'
b'what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in \n'
b'the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a \n'
b'small son too but they had never even seen him \n'
b'this boy was another good reason for keeping the \n'
b'potters away; they didnt want dudley mixing with a \n'
b'when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray \n'
b'tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the \n'
b'cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \n'
b'mysterious things would soon be happening all over \n'
b'the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out \n'
b'his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley \n'
b'gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \n'
b'dudley into his high chair \n'
b'none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past \n'
b'at half past eight mr dursley picked up his \n'
b'briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and \n'
b'tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because \n'
b'dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \n'
b'cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley \n'
b'as he left the house he got into his car and backed \n'
b'out of number fours drive \n'
b'it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \n'
b'first sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a \n'
b'map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he \n'
b'had seen  then he jerked his head around to look \n'
b'again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner \n'
b'of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what \n'
b'could he have been thinking of it must have been a \n'
b'trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at \n'
Page3
b'the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around \n'
b'the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his \n'
b'mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet \n'
b'drive  no looking at the sign; cats couldnt read \n'
b'maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake \n'
b'and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward \n'
b'town he thought of nothing except a large order of \n'
b'drills he was hoping to get that day \n'
b'but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his \n'
b'mind by something else as he sat in the usual \n'
b'morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that \n'
b'there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \n'
b'about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear \n'
b'people who dressed in funny clothes  the getups \n'
b'you saw on young people he supposed this was some \n'
b'stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the \n'
b'steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \n'
b'weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering \n'
b'excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see \n'
b'that a couple of them werent young at all; why that \n'
b'man had to be older than he was and wearing an \n'
b'emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it \n'
b'struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly \n'
b'stunt  these people were obviously collecting for \n'
b'something  yes that would be it the traffic moved \n'
b'on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the \n'
b'grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills \n'
b'mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in \n'
b'his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might \n'
b'have found it harder to concentrate on drills that \n'
b'morning he didnt see the owls swooping past in \n'
b'broad daylight though people down in the street did; \n'
b'they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after \n'
b'owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an \n'
b'owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a \n'
b'perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five \n'
b'different people he made several important telephone \n'
Page4
b'calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good \n'
b'mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch \n'
b'his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \n'
b'bun from the bakery \n'
b'hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \n'
b'passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed \n'
b'them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but \n'
b'they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering \n'
b'excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting \n'
b'tin it was on his way back past them clutching a \n'
b'large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words \n'
b'of what they were saying \n'
b'the potters thats right thats what i heard   \n'
b'  yes their son harry   \n'
b'mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he \n'
b'looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \n'
b'something to them but thought better of it \n'
b'he dashed back across the road hurried up to his \n'
b'office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him \n'
b'seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing \n'
b'his home number when he changed his mind he put \n'
b'the receiver back down and stroked his mustache \n'
b'thinking  no he was being stupid potter wasnt \n'
b'such an unusual name he was sure there were lots \n'
b'of people called potter who had a son called harry \n'
b'come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew \n'
b'was called harry hed never even seen the boy it \n'
b'might have been harvey or harold there was no \n'
b'point in worrying mrs dursley; she always got so \n'
b'upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame \n'
b'her  if hed had a sister like that  but all the \n'
b'same those people in cloaks  \n'
Page5
b'he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \n'
b'afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock \n'
b'he was still so worried that he walked straight into \n'
b'someone just outside the door \n'
b'sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled \n'
b'and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr \n'
b'dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \n'
b'cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost \n'
b'knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split \n'
b'into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \n'
b'made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir \n'
b'for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you \n'
b'knowwho has gone at last even muggles like \n'
b'yourself should be celebrating this happy happy \n'
b'and the old man hugged mr dursley around the \n'
b'middle and walked off \n'
b'mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been \n'
b'hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he \n'
b'had been called a muggle whatever that was he was \n'
b'rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home \n'
b'hoping he was imagining things which he had never \n'
b'hoped before because he didnt approve of \n'
b'as he pulled into the driveway of number four the \n'
b'first thing he saw  and it didnt improve his mood  \n'
b'was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was \n'
b'now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the \n'
b'same one; it had the same markings around its eyes \n'
b'shoo said mr dursley loudly \n'
b'the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look \n'
b'was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered \n'
b'trying to pull himself together he let himself into the \n'
Page6
b'house he was still determined not to mention \n'
b'anything to his wife \n'
b'mrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told \n'
b'him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems \n'
b'with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new \n'
b'word wont mr dursley tried to act normally \n'
b'when dudley had been put to bed he went into the \n'
b'living room in time to catch the last report on the \n'
b'and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported \n'
b'that the nations owls have been behaving very \n'
b'unusually today although owls normally hunt at \n'
b'night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have \n'
b'been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \n'
b'every direction since sunrise experts are unable to \n'
b'explain why the owls have suddenly changed their \n'
b'sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a \n'
b'grin most mysterious and now over to jim \n'
b'mcguffin with the weather going to be any more \n'
b'showers of owls tonight jim \n'
b'well ted said the weatherman i dont know about \n'
b'that but its not only the owls that have been acting \n'
b'oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire \n'
b'and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \n'
b'instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a \n'
b'downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have \n'
b'been celebrating bonfire night early  its not until \n'
b'next week folks but i can promise a wet night \n'
b'mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars \n'
b'all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious \n'
b'people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a \n'
b'whisper about the potters    \n'
Page7
b'mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two \n'
b'cups of tea it was no good hed have to say \n'
b'something to her he cleared his throat nervously er \n'
b' petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister \n'
b'as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and \n'
b'angry after all they normally pretended she didnt \n'
b'no she said sharply why \n'
b'funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled \n'
b'owls    shooting stars    and there were a lot of \n'
b'funnylooking people in town today  \n'
b'so snapped mrs dursley \n'
b'well i just thought  maybe  it was something to \n'
b'do with  you know  her crowd \n'
b'mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr \n'
b'dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed \n'
b'heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare \n'
b'instead he said as casually as he could their son  \n'
b'hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he \n'
b'i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly \n'
b'whats his name again howard isnt it \n'
b'harry nasty common name if you ask me \n'
b'oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking \n'
b'horribly yes i quite agree \n'
b'he didnt say another word on the subject as they \n'
b'went upstairs to bed while mrs dursley was in the \n'
b'bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window \n'
Page8
b'and peered down into the front garden the cat was \n'
b'still there it was staring down privet drive as though \n'
b'it were waiting for something \n'
b'was he imagining things could all this have \n'
b'anything to do with the potters if it did  if it got out \n'
b'that they were related to a pair of  well he didnt \n'
b'think he could bear it \n'
b'the dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep \n'
b'quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over \n'
b'in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell \n'
b'asleep was that even if the potters were involved \n'
b'there was no reason for them to come near him and \n'
b'mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and \n'
b'petunia thought about them and their kind  he \n'
b'couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up \n'
b'in anything that might be going on  he yawned and \n'
b'turned over  it couldnt affect them  \n'
b'how very wrong he was \n'
b'mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \n'
b'sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \n'
b'sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue \n'
b'its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet \n'
b'drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door \n'
b'slammed on the next street nor when two owls \n'
b'swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight \n'
b'before the cat moved at all \n'
b'a man appeared on the corner the cat had been \n'
b'watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd \n'
b'have thought hed just popped out of the ground the \n'
b'cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed \n'
b'nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet \n'
b'drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the \n'
b'silver of his hair and beard which were both long \n'
Page9
b'enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long \n'
b'robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and \n'
b'highheeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light \n'
b'bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles \n'
b'and his nose was very long and crooked as though it \n'
b'had been broken at least twice this mans name was \n'
b'albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had \n'
b'just arrived in a street where everything from his \n'
b'name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy \n'
b'rummaging in his cloak looking for something but \n'
b'he did seem to realize he was being watched because \n'
b'he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still \n'
b'staring at him from the other end of the street for \n'
b'some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \n'
b'him he chuckled and muttered i should have \n'
b'he found what he was looking for in his inside \n'
b'pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he \n'
b'flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it \n'
b'the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he \n'
b'clicked it again  the next lamp flickered into \n'
b'darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter \n'
b'until the only lights left on the whole street were two \n'
b'tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of \n'
b'the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their \n'
b'window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they \n'
b'wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening \n'
b'down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the put \n'
b'outer back inside his cloak and set off down the \n'
b'street toward number four where he sat down on the \n'
b'wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a \n'
b'moment he spoke to it \n'
b'fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall \n'
Page10
b'he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone \n'
b'instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking \n'
b'woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \n'
b'shape of the markings the cat had had around its \n'
b'eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one \n'
b'her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she \n'
b'looked distinctly ruffled \n'
b'how did you know it was me she asked \n'
b'my dear professor ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly \n'
b'youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all \n'
b'day said professor mcgonagall \n'
b'all day when you could have been celebrating i \n'
b'must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \n'
b'professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily \n'
b'oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said \n'
b'impatiently youd think theyd be a bit more careful \n'
b'but no  even the muggles have noticed somethings \n'
b'going on it was on their news she jerked her head \n'
b'back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i \n'
b'heard it flocks of owls  shooting stars  well \n'
b'theyre not completely stupid they were bound to \n'
b'notice something shooting stars down in kent  ill \n'
b'bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much \n'
b'you cant blame them said dumbledore gently \n'
b'weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \n'
b'i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably \n'
b'but thats no reason to lose our heads people are \n'
b'being downright careless out on the streets in broad \n'
Page11
b'daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes \n'
b'she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore \n'
b'here as though hoping he was going to tell her \n'
b'something but he didnt so she went on a fine \n'
b'thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho \n'
b'seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found \n'
b'out about us all i suppose he really has gone \n'
b'it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have \n'
b'much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon \n'
b'a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im \n'
b'no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as \n'
b'though she didnt think this was the moment for \n'
b'lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has \n'
b'my dear professor surely a sensible person like \n'
b'yourself can call him by his name all this you \n'
b'knowwho nonsense  for eleven years i have been \n'
b'trying to persuade people to call him by his proper \n'
b'name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but \n'
b'dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops \n'
b'seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we \n'
b'keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any \n'
b'reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name \n'
b'i know you havent said professor mcgonagall \n'
b'sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre \n'
b'different everyone knows youre the only one you \n'
b'know oh all right voldemort was frightened of \n'
Page12
b'you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort \n'
b'had powers i will never have \n'
b'only because youre too  well  noble to use \n'
b'its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since \n'
b'madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs \n'
b'professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at \n'
b'dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to \n'
b'the rumors that are flying around you know what \n'
b'everyones saying about why hes disappeared \n'
b'about what finally stopped him \n'
b'it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the \n'
b'point she was most anxious to discuss the real \n'
b'reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all \n'
b'day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she \n'
b'fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she \n'
b'did now it was plain that whatever everyone was \n'
b'saying she was not going to believe it until \n'
b'dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore \n'
b'however was choosing another lemon drop and did \n'
b'what theyre saying she pressed on is that last \n'
b'night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he \n'
b'went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and \n'
b'james potter are  are  that theyre  dead \n'
b'dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall \n'
b'lily and james  i cant believe it  i didnt want to \n'
b'believe it  oh albus  \n'
b'dumbledore reached out and patted her on the \n'
b'shoulder i know  i know  he said heavily \n'
Page13
b'professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went \n'
b'on thats not all theyre saying he tried to kill the \n'
b'potters son harry but  he couldnt he couldnt \n'
b'kill that little boy no one knows why or how but \n'
b'theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter \n'
b'voldemorts power somehow broke  and thats why \n'
b'dumbledore nodded glumly \n'
b'its  its true faltered professor mcgonagall after \n'
b'all hes done  all the people hes killed  he couldnt \n'
b'kill a little boy its just astounding  of all the \n'
b'things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven \n'
b'we can only guess said dumbledore we may \n'
b'professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \n'
b'and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles \n'
b'dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden \n'
b'watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very \n'
b'odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers; \n'
b'instead little planets were moving around the edge it \n'
b'must have made sense to dumbledore though \n'
b'because he put it back in his pocket and said \n'
b'hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be \n'
b'yes said professor mcgonagall and i dont \n'
b'suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all \n'
b'ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle \n'
b'theyre the only family he has left now \n'
b'you dont mean  you cant mean the people who \n'
b'live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her \n'
Page14
b'feet and pointing at number four dumbledore  you \n'
b'cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt \n'
b'find two people who are less like us and theyve got \n'
b'this son  i saw him kicking his mother all the way \n'
b'up the street screaming for sweets harry potter \n'
b'its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly \n'
b'his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \n'
b'to him when hes older ive written them a letter \n'
b'a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly \n'
b'sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore \n'
b'you think you can explain all this in a letter these \n'
b'people will never understand him hell be famous  \n'
b'a legend  i wouldnt be surprised if today was \n'
b'known as harry potter day in the future  there will \n'
b'be books written about harry  every child in our \n'
b'world will know his name \n'
b'exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously \n'
b'over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be \n'
b'enough to turn any boys head famous before he can \n'
b'walk and talk famous for something he wont even \n'
b'remember cant you see how much better off hell be \n'
b'growing up away from all that until hes ready to take \n'
b'professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her \n'
b'mind swallowed and then said yes  yes youre \n'
b'right of course but how is the boy getting here \n'
b'dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though \n'
b'she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it \n'
b'hagrids bringing him \n'
b'you think it  wise  to trust hagrid with \n'
b'something as important as this \n'
Page15
b'i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore \n'
b'im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said \n'
b'professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant \n'
b'pretend hes not careless he does tend to  what \n'
b'a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \n'
b'them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and \n'
b'down the street for some sign of a headlight; it \n'
b'swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  \n'
b'and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \n'
b'on the road in front of them \n'
b'if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man \n'
b'sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a \n'
b'normal man and at least five times as wide he looked \n'
b'simply too big to be allowed and so wild  long \n'
b'tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \n'
b'face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his \n'
b'feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in \n'
b'his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of \n'
b'hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at \n'
b'last and where did you get that motorcycle \n'
b'borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the \n'
b'giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he \n'
b'spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him \n'
b'no problems were there \n'
b'no sir  house was almost destroyed but i got him \n'
b'out all right before the muggles started swarmin \n'
b'around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol \n'
Page16
b'dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward \n'
b'over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a \n'
b'baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair \n'
b'over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \n'
b'cut like a bolt of lightning \n'
b'is that where   whispered professor mcgonagall \n'
b'yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever \n'
b'couldnt you do something about it dumbledore \n'
b'even if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy \n'
b'i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \n'
b'map of the london underground well  give him \n'
b'here hagrid  wed better get this over with \n'
b'dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned \n'
b'toward the dursleys house \n'
b'could i  could i say goodbye to him sir asked \n'
b'hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry \n'
b'and gave him what must have been a very scratchy \n'
b'whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl \n'
b'shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the \n'
b'sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted \n'
b'handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cc \n'
b'cant stand it  lily an james dead  an poor little \n'
b'harry off ter live with muggles   \n'
b'yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself \n'
b'hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall \n'
b'whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as \n'
b'dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \n'
b'walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the \n'
Page17
b'doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it \n'
b'inside harrys blankets and then came back to the \n'
b'other two for a full minute the three of them stood \n'
b'and looked at the little bundle; hagrids shoulders \n'
b'shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and \n'
b'the twinkling light that usually shone from \n'
b'dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out \n'
b'well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no \n'
b'business staying here we may as well go and join the \n'
b'yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice id best \n'
b'get this bike away g night professor mcgonagall  \n'
b'professor dumbledore sir \n'
b'wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid \n'
b'swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the \n'
b'engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off \n'
b'i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall \n'
b'said dumbledore nodding to her professor \n'
b'mcgonagall blew her nose in reply \n'
b'dumbledore turned and walked back down the street \n'
b'on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put \n'
b'outer he clicked it once and twelve balls of light \n'
b'sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive \n'
b'glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \n'
b'tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \n'
b'of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets \n'
b'on the step of number four \n'
b'good luck harry he murmured he turned on his \n'
b'heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone \n'
b'a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which \n'
b'lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last \n'
Page18
b'place you would expect astonishing things to happen \n'
b'harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without \n'
b'waking up one small hand closed on the letter \n'
b'beside him and he slept on not knowing he was \n'
b'special not knowing he was famous not knowing he \n'
b'would be woken in a few hours time by mrs \n'
b'dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put \n'
b'out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next \n'
b'few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin \n'
b'dudley  he couldnt know that at this very \n'
b'moment people meeting in secret all over the country \n'
b'were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed \n'
b'voices to harry potter  the boy who lived \n'
Page19
b'nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had \n'
b'woken up to find their nephew on the front step but \n'
b'privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose \n'
b'on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \n'
b'number four on the dursleys front door; it crept into \n'
b'their living room which was almost exactly the same \n'
b'as it had been on the night when mr dursley had \n'
b'seen that fateful news report about the owls only the \n'
b'photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \n'
b'much time had passed ten years ago there had been \n'
b'lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \n'
b'ball wearing differentcolored bonnets  but dudley \n'
b'dursley was no longer a baby and now the \n'
b'photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \n'
b'bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer \n'
b'game with his father being hugged and kissed by his \n'
b'mother the room held no sign at all that another boy \n'
b'lived in the house too \n'
b'yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment \n'
b'but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it \n'
Page20
b'was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \n'
b'harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door \n'
b'up she screeched harry heard her walking toward \n'
b'the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \n'
b'being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and \n'
b'tried to remember the dream he had been having it \n'
b'had been a good one there had been a flying \n'
b'motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the \n'
b'his aunt was back outside the door \n'
b'are you up yet she demanded \n'
b'well get a move on i want you to look after the \n'
b'bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want \n'
b'everything perfect on duddys birthday \n'
b'what did you say his aunt snapped through the \n'
b'dudleys birthday  how could he have forgotten \n'
b'harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \n'
b'socks he found a pair under his bed and after \n'
b'pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry \n'
b'was used to spiders because the cupboard under the \n'
b'stairs was full of them and that was where he slept \n'
Page21
b'when he was dressed he went down the hall into the \n'
b'kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all \n'
b'dudleys birthday presents it looked as though \n'
b'dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not \n'
b'to mention the second television and the racing bike \n'
b'exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a \n'
b'mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated \n'
b'exercise  unless of course it involved punching \n'
b'somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry \n'
b'but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it \n'
b'but he was very fast \n'
b'perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \n'
b'cupboard but harry had always been small and \n'
b'skinny for his age he looked even smaller and \n'
b'skinnier than he really was because all he had to \n'
b'wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was \n'
b'about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin \n'
b'face knobbly knees black hair and bright green \n'
b'eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot \n'
b'of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had \n'
b'punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked \n'
b'about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \n'
b'forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he \n'
b'had had it as long as he could remember and the \n'
b'first question he could ever remember asking his \n'
b'aunt petunia was how he had gotten it \n'
b'in the car crash when your parents died she had \n'
b'said and dont ask questions \n'
b'dont ask questions  that was the first rule for a \n'
b'quiet life with the dursleys \n'
b'uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was \n'
b'turning over the bacon \n'
b'comb your hair he barked by way of a morning \n'
Page22
b'about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top \n'
b'of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a \n'
b'haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the \n'
b'rest of the boys in his class put together but it made \n'
b'no difference his hair simply grew that way  all over \n'
b'harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in \n'
b'the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like \n'
b'uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much \n'
b'neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair \n'
b'that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia \n'
b'often said that dudley looked like a baby angel  \n'
b'harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a \n'
b'harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table \n'
b'which was difficult as there wasnt much room \n'
b'dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his \n'
b'thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and \n'
b'father thats two less than last year \n'
b'darling you havent counted auntie marges present \n'
b'see its here under this big one from mommy and \n'
b'all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red \n'
b'in the face harry who could see a huge dudley \n'
b'tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as \n'
b'fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over \n'
b'aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because \n'
b'she said quickly and well buy you another two \n'
b'presents while were out today hows that popkin \n'
b'two more presents is that all right \n'
Page23
b'dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard \n'
b'work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty  \n'
b'thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia \n'
b'oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the \n'
b'nearest parcel all right then \n'
b'uncle vernon chuckled \n'
b'little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his \n'
b'father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair \n'
b'at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia \n'
b'went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon \n'
b'watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video \n'
b'camera a remote control airplane sixteen new \n'
b'computer games and a vcr he was ripping the \n'
b'paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came \n'
b'back from the telephone looking both angry and \n'
b'bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her \n'
b'leg she cant take him she jerked her head in \n'
b'dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart \n'
b'gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his \n'
b'parents took him and a friend out for the day to \n'
b'adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the \n'
b'movies every year harry was left behind with mrs \n'
b'figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away \n'
b'harry hated it there the whole house smelled of \n'
b'cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs \n'
b'of all the cats shed ever owned \n'
b'now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at \n'
b'harry as though hed planned this harry knew he \n'
Page24
b'ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg \n'
b'but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would \n'
b'be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies \n'
b'snowy mr paws and tufty again \n'
b'we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested \n'
b'dont be silly vernon she hates the boy \n'
b'the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as \n'
b'though he wasnt there  or rather as though he was \n'
b'something very nasty that couldnt understand them \n'
b'what about whatshername your friend  \n'
b'on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia \n'
b'you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully \n'
b'hed be able to watch what he wanted on television \n'
b'for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys \n'
b'aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a \n'
b'and come back and find the house in ruins she \n'
b'i wont blow up the house said harry but they \n'
b'i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt \n'
b'petunia slowly " and leave him in the car  \n'
b'that cars new hes not sitting in it alone  \n'
Page25
b'dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really \n'
b'crying  it had been years since hed really cried  \n'
b'but he knew that if he screwed up his face and \n'
b'wailed his mother would give him anything he \n'
b'dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him \n'
b'spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms \n'
b'i  dont  want  him  ttto come dudley \n'
b'yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp \n'
b'spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through \n'
b'the gap in his mothers arms \n'
b'just then the doorbell rang  oh good lord \n'
b'theyre here said aunt petunia frantically  and a \n'
b'moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss \n'
b'walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy \n'
b'with a face like a rat he was usually the one who \n'
b'held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley \n'
b'hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once \n'
b'half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his \n'
b'luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with \n'
b'piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first \n'
b'time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able \n'
b'to think of anything else to do with him but before \n'
b'theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside \n'
b'im warning you he had said putting his large \n'
b'purple face right up close to harrys im warning you \n'
b'now boy  any funny business anything at all  \n'
b'and youll be in that cupboard from now until \n'
b'im not going to do anything said harry honestly \n'
Page26
b'but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did \n'
b'the problem was strange things often happened \n'
b'around harry and it was just no good telling the \n'
b'dursleys he didnt make them happen \n'
b'once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from \n'
b'the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all \n'
b'had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair \n'
b'so short he was almost bald except for his bangs \n'
b'which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had \n'
b'laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless \n'
b'night imagining school the next day where he was \n'
b'already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped \n'
b'glasses next morning however he had gotten up to \n'
b'find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt \n'
b'petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week \n'
b'in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to \n'
b'explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown \n'
b'another time aunt petunia had been trying to force \n'
b'him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown \n'
b'with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it \n'
b'over his head the smaller it seemed to become until \n'
b'finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but \n'
b'certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided \n'
b'it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great \n'
b'relief harry wasnt punished \n'
b'on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble \n'
b'for being found on the roof of the school kitchens \n'
b'dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when \n'
b'as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he \n'
b'was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had \n'
b'received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress \n'
b'telling them harry had been climbing school \n'
b'buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at \n'
b'uncle vernon through the locked door of his \n'
Page27
b'cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans \n'
b'outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the \n'
b'wind must have caught him in midjump \n'
b'but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even \n'
b'worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the \n'
b'day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or \n'
b'mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room \n'
b'while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt \n'
b'petunia he liked to complain about things people at \n'
b'work harry the council harry the bank and harry \n'
b'were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning \n'
b'" roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums \n'
b'he said as a motorcycle overtook them \n'
b'i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry \n'
b'remembering suddenly it was flying \n'
b'uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he \n'
b'turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry \n'
b'his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache \n'
b'motorcycles dont fly \n'
b'dudley and piers sniggered \n'
b'i know they dont said harry it was only a dream \n'
b'but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was \n'
b'one thing the dursleys hated even more than his \n'
b'asking questions it was his talking about anything \n'
b'acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a \n'
b'dream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he \n'
b'might get dangerous ideas \n'
b'it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was \n'
b'crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley \n'
Page28
b'and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \n'
b'and then because the smiling lady in the van had \n'
b'asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry \n'
b'him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it \n'
b'wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they \n'
b'watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked \n'
b'remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond \n'
b'harry had the best morning hed had in a long time \n'
b'he was careful to walk a little way apart from the \n'
b'dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting \n'
b'to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt \n'
b'fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they \n'
b'ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a \n'
b'tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have \n'
b'enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him \n'
b'another one and harry was allowed to finish the first \n'
b'harry felt afterward that he should have known it \n'
b'was all too good to last \n'
b'after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool \n'
b'and dark in there with lit windows all along the \n'
b'walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes \n'
b'were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \n'
b'stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge \n'
b'poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons \n'
b'dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it \n'
b'could have wrapped its body twice around uncle \n'
b'vernons car and crushed it into a trash can  but at \n'
b'the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was \n'
b'dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass \n'
b'staring at the glistening brown coils \n'
b'make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon \n'
b'tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge \n'
Page29
b'do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped \n'
b'the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake \n'
b'this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away \n'
b'harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \n'
b'at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it \n'
b'had died of boredom itself  no company except \n'
b'stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \n'
b'trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than \n'
b'having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only \n'
b'visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to \n'
b'wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the \n'
b'the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly \n'
b'very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a \n'
b'harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if \n'
b'anyone was watching they werent he looked back \n'
b'at the snake and winked too \n'
b'the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and \n'
b'dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave \n'
b'harry a look that said quite plainly \n'
b'i get that all the time \n'
b'i know harry murmured through the glass though \n'
b'he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be \n'
b'the snake nodded vigorously \n'
b'where do you come from anyway harry asked \n'
Page30
b'the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the \n'
b'glass harry peered at it \n'
b'boa constrictor brazil \n'
b'the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again \n'
b'and harry read on this specimen was bred in the \n'
b'zoo oh i see  so youve never been to brazil \n'
b'as the snake shook its head a deafening shout \n'
b'behind harry made both of them jump dudley \n'
b'mr dursley come and look at this snake \n'
b'you wont believe what its doing \n'
b'dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he \n'
b'out of the way you he said punching harry in the \n'
b'ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the \n'
b'concrete floor what came next happened so fast no \n'
b'one saw how it happened  one second piers and \n'
b'dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the \n'
b'next they had leapt back with howls of horror \n'
b'harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \n'
b'constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was \n'
b'uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor \n'
b'people throughout the reptile house screamed and \n'
b'started running for the exits \n'
b'as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have \n'
b'sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come \n'
b'the keeper of the reptile house was in shock \n'
